# Monetization  
  
This folder contains ad monetization for Code Scanner.  
Google AdMob is used as the advertising library for Code Scanner.  
***Do note that advertising is ONLY for the variant on Google Play.***  
***No other version of the app would contain advertising and they would all contain stubs returning null, hence advertising will not be implemented for non-Play platforms.***  
The F-Droid version (planned, TODO) will never contain advertisements as it is an anti-feature, and open-source advertising is difficult.
  
All advertisements in this app will be child-friendly and appropriate for all audiences.  
  
## Rationale
Advertising helps the author (czlucius) to maintain this app and bring more features. With Ad Monetization, development for this app can continue and more features can be added. Thank you for your understanding.
